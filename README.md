# Intuition Snap

The **Intuition Snap** enhances your MetaMask experience by providing crowdsourced insights and context about Ethereum addresses you interact with. By leveraging the wisdom of the crowd, this Snap enables you to make more informed decisions about who you’re transacting with directly within your MetaMask wallet.

## What is Intuition?

Intuition empowers MetaMask users to:
- **View Community-Sourced Insights**: Access information, reviews, and opinions from other users about any Ethereum address.
- **Contribute Knowledge**: Share your own experiences with addresses to help others in the community.
- **Make Safer, Informed Decisions**: Gain deeper insights into smart contracts and wallets before interacting with them.
- **Access Crowd Wisdom Seamlessly**: Integrates directly into MetaMask, making insights easily accessible without leaving your wallet.

## Why Use Intuition Snap?

The Intuition Snap provides a decentralized, community-driven layer of trust for interacting with Ethereum addresses. Whether you're transacting with individuals, smart contracts, or DeFi applications, having access to crowd-sourced insights helps you:
- **Avoid Scams and Phishing**: Spot potential red flags or risky addresses flagged by the community.
- **Build Trust**: Discover trusted addresses or reputable projects validated by other users.
- **Enhance Security**: Get additional information about the contract or wallet before interacting, helping you avoid risky transactions.

## Snaps is Pre-Release Software

To use the Intuition Snap, you’ll need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), a developer-focused version of MetaMask that provides early access to upcoming features like Snaps. Since Snaps is currently in pre-release, it is intended for testing and development, so please exercise caution when using it with real assets.
